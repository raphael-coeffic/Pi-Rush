# 🔢 Pi Jumper

Sling, land, remember — climb the digits of Pi!

## Concept:

Pi Jumper is a fast-paced memory and timing game where the player launches a character from circle to circle, each marked with a digit of Pi. To progress, the player must hit the correct next digit in sequence. One mistake sends the player back, encouraging focus, pattern recognition, and memory training — all while feeling like a simple, addictive arcade game.

## Platform:

## Formal Elements:
### 1. Players

Target players: Ages 10+, anyone who enjoys casual arcade games or wants to improve memory.

Number of players: 1 player (with optional asynchronous leaderboard competition).

Interaction patterns: Solo gameplay; optional indirect competition via scores and rankings.

### 2. Goals

Primary objective: Progress as far as possible by correctly landing on the next digit of Pi.
When the game starts, a brief flash note shows the objective, telling the player to reach the highest score possible.

### 3. Processes

Game start (first 30 sec): Player greeted with flash note explaining goal, Player sees first circles, one of them marked “3”, the other 2 circles on the first level with random digits (wrong options). tutorial overlay shows how to sling the character to the next circle. Interaction via touch and hold.

Core gameplay: Launch character from circle to circle, following Pi sequence. Each correct digit moves the player forward; mistakes send the player back to the start.

Endgame: Player fails a jump. Score displayed, ranking updated.

Learning integration: Memorization is directly linked to progression — players practice recalling digits naturally through gameplay, without explicit study.

### 4. Rules

Only one correct digit per jump.

Missing the correct digit resets the player.

Player cannot jump infinitely; must aim within defined circle range.

Rules taught via visual cues and immediate feedback on mistakes.

### 5. Resources

Resources: Additional Lives, Hints, Accessories.

Utility: Lives allow retries; Hints help point at correct next digit.

Acquisition: Earned through progression milestones.

Scarcity: Limited boosts/lives encourage precision.

Display: HUD shows lives, current score, and highest score.

### 6. Conflicts

Player vs system: Timing and memory challenge of choosing the next correct digit.

Player vs player: Leaderboards for score comparison.

Player vs self: Focus and recall under increasing sequence length and pressure.

### 7. Boundaries

Game world is linear and vertically structured (ascending through digits).

Circles are arranged in static positions; player cannot move outside the defined play area.

Design principles: Clear visual guidance, incremental difficulty, meaningful progress.

### 8. Outcomes

Outcome measured by score and highest sequence reached.

Largely skill-based; minimal luck.

Competitive but non-zero-sum — players aim to improve personal or leaderboard performance.

## Existing Games Review

Search terms used: “Pi memorization game,” “math memory game,” “Character launcher game.”

Similar games:

Sling Kong - An animal launching game where you progress upwards.

Pi Memorization - A simple typing based memorization game for Pi.

Memory Tower – memorize numbers to progress.

Our difference: Pi Jumper combines timed action, skill-based slinging, and visual target landing with memorization, making learning an invisible, fun part of progression. Emphasis on movement + memory integration sets it apart from purely static or click-based memorization games.
